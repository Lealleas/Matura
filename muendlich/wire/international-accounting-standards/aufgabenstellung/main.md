## Buchführung u. Jahresabschluss: International Accounting Standards

An International Accounting Standard, commonly referred to as IAS, can be viewed as a common global language for business affairs so that company accounts are understandable and comparable across international boundaries. They are a consequence of growing international shareholding and trade and are particularly important for companies that have dealings in several countries. They are rules to be followed by accountants to maintain books of accounts which are comparable, understandable, reliable and relevant.

### List all the components of a financial statement

- A statement of financial position (balance sheet) at the end of the period 

- A statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the period (presented as a single statement, or by presenting the profit or loss section in a separate statement of profit or loss, immediately followed by a statement presenting comprehensive income beginning with profit or loss) 

- A statement of changes in equity for the period 

- A statement of cash flows for the period notes, comprising a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory notes 

- Comparative information prescribed by the standard.

### Analyse which parties are the most influential in the development of an accounting standard

The IASB conducts a comprehensive review of its technical agenda every three years, although, of course, it stands ready to address urgent issues rapidly if the need arises. On the basis of public input received during the triennial agenda consultation, the IASB develops a three- to  five-year agenda of projects. Apart from the reviews, the IASB and/or the Interpretations Committee evaluate all requests received for possible interpretation or amendment of a Standard. (see attachment1.png)

### Interprate why the adoption of an accounting standard is a good idea

Today, the world’s fnancial markets are borderless. Companies (including small companies) seek capital at the best price wherever it is available. Investors and lenders seek investment opportunities wherever they can get the best returns commensurate with the risks involved. To assess the risks and returns of their various investment opportunities, investors and lenders need  nancial information that is relevant, reliable and comparable across borders.

The use of one set of high quality standards by companies throughout the world improves the comparability and transparency of financial information and reduces  nancial statement preparation costs. When the standards are applied rigorously and consistently, capital market participants receive higher quality information and can make better decisions.
Thus, markets allocate funds more ef ciently and  rms can achieve a lower cost of capital.
A comprehensive review of nearly 100 academic studies of the bene ts of IFRS concluded that most of the studies ‘provide evidence that IFRS has improved ef ciency of capital market operations and promoted cross-border investment’.
