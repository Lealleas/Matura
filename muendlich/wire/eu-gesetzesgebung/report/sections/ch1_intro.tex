The European Union can be a rather complicated political system for anyone who has never put much effort in understanding it. The basics are known to most people, however, when it comes to more profound topics such the actual regions that are part of the EU, the financial distribution, or the process of creating a new law. This paper focuses on the lastly named process, or as it is called with more professional law: the legislative procedure. The papers covers a basic overview of the Institutions and Organisations that have a part of the procedure, as well as an easy to understand showcase of the different types that the European Union follows.
