## Grundzüge des österreichischen Rechtssystems: EU Gesetzgebung
The legislatives European Union develops laws that also affect Austria. The procedure behind it has been created specifically for the Union.### Describe the necessary steps in the European Union's law development process.

__Ordinary Legislative procedure__ (See attachment1.pdf)

The ordinary legislative procedure is the main egislative procedure by which directives and regulations are adopted. The procedure was introduced with the Maastricht Treaty as the codecision procedure.

Main elements of the procedure:

1. The European Commission submits a proposal to the Council and the European Parliament
2. The Council and the Parliament adopt a legislative proposal either at the first reading or at the second reading
3. If the two institutions do not reach an agreement after the second reading a conciliation committee is convened
4. If the text agreed by the conciliation committee is acceptable to both institutions at the third reading, the legislative act is adopted

If a legislative proposal is rejected at any stage of the procedure, or the Parliament and Council cannot reach a compromise, the proposal is not adopted and the procedure ends.


### Analyse which other procedures are possible and when they are being used

__Special legislative procedures__: The treaties have provision for special legislative 	procedures to be used in sensitive areas.
	
* Consultation procedure
	
	Under this procedure the Council, acting either 	unanimously or by a qualified majority depending 	on the policy area concerned, can adopt 	legislation based on a proposal by the European 	Commission after consulting the European 	Parliament. While being required to consult 	Parliament on legislative proposals, the Council 	is not bound by Parliament's position. In 	practice the Council would frequently ignore 	whatever Parliament might suggest and even 	sometimes reach an agreement before receiving 	Parliament's opinion
	
* Consent procedure

	In the consent procedure (formerly assent 	procedure), the Council can adopt legislation 	based on a proposal by the European Commission 	after obtaining the consent of Parliament. Thus 	Parliament has the legal power to accept or 	reject any proposal but no legal mechanism 	exists for proposing amendments. Parliament has 	however provided for conciliation committee and 	a procedure for giving interim reports where it 	can address its concerns to the Council and 	threaten to withhold its consent unless its 	concerns are met
	

* Commisssion acting alone

	In a few limited areas, the Commission has the 	authority to adopt regulatory or technical 	legislation without consulting or obtaining the 	consent of other bodies. The Commission can 	adopt legislation on its own initiative 	concerning monopolies and concessions granted to 	companies by Member States and concerning the 	right of workers to remain in a Member State 	after having been employed there.
	 	

### Interprate which possible issue or challenge the standard legislative procedure can have

Under the ordinary legislative procedure, the European Parliament has the right to propose amendments to the proposals for new laws that come from the Commission. Commission proposals, Parliament's amendments and the Council's common position are then considered in a so-called "trialogue" meeting with representatives from the three institutions who seek to negotiate an agreement or a compromise. It is often not known what goes on behind the doors.
