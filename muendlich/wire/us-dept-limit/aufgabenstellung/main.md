## Wirtschaft und Recht im intern. Kontext: Amerikanische Kreditgrenze

The debt limit is the total amount of money that the United States government is authorized to borrow to meet its existing legal obligations, including Social Security and Medicare benefits, mil- itary salaries, interest on the national debt, tax refunds, and other payments.

### Explain the reasoning behind the Dept Limit

The debt limit can hinder the Treasury’s ability to manage the federal government’s finances, as noted above. In extreme cases, when the federal debt is very near its statutory limit, the Treasury must take unusual and extraordinary measures to meet federal obligations. While the debt limit has never caused the federal government to default on its obligations, it has at times caused great inconvenience and has added uncertainty to Treasury operations.
The debt limit also provides Congress with the strings to control the federal purse, allowing Congress to assert its constitutional prerogatives to control spending. The debt limit also imposes a form of fiscal accountability that compels Congress and the President to take visible action to allow further federal borrowing when the federal government spends more than it collects in rev- enues. In the words of one author, the debt limit “expresses a national devotion to the idea of thrift and to economical management of the fiscal affairs of the government.” On the other hand, some budget experts have advocated elimination of the debt limit, arguing that other controls provided by the modern congressional budget process established in 1974 have superseded the debt limit, and that the limit does little to alter spending and revenue policies that determine the size of the federal deficit.

### Analyse the drivers of the U.S. Dept Limit
- An aging population, rising health care costs, growing interest payments on the debt and insufficient revenue are the primary drivers of the long-term debt.
- Little has been done to address the long-term drivers of the debt through fundamental tax and entitlement reform.
- Ten years from now, three-fourths of all federal spending will go to mandatory items (mostly health care programs and Social Security) and interest on the debt.
- Interest payments on the debt represent the fastest growing part of the federal budget and will reach 15% of the budget by 2025 and will continue rising, crowding out critical investments.
- An unexpected 1 percentage point increase above projected rates would cost the country $1.2 trillion over a decade, and if interest rates returned to the record-high levels of the 1980s, the country would pay $6.2 trillion more in interest.
- The U.S. tax code’s wide array of deductions, exemptions, and loopholes – known as tax expenditures, or spending through the tax code – represent $1.2 trillion in lost revenue for the Treasury this year alone.

### Interprate the possible consequences of rising debt

- Rising national debt will hamper public investment needed to grow the economy because federal spending on items like infrastructure, education and research will be crowded out by increased interest payments on the debt.
- Higher federal debt translates into higher interest rates down the road and less capital available for small businesses, large companies, and families to borrow and invest.
- Families will feel the effects of rising debt through increased costs of home loans, automobile loans, credit cards, and educational expenses because of higher interest rates.
- Interest rates would be 1 point higher 25 years from now because of high debt, according to CBO. Put another way, a family with a $300,000 mortgage can expect to pay at least $45,000 more over the course of the mortgage.
- The lack of investment because of high national debt will result in fewer job opportunities and lower wages.
- According to the Congressional Budget Office, wages will grow 10% less over the next two decades with debt on an upward path compared to a downward path. In today’s dollars, that’s more than a $7,000 wage cut. And over a 40-year career starting today, it represents $250,000 in lost income.
- Higher debt means leaving the next generation saddled with it, reducing their budget flexibility and the ability of the United States to respond to crises in the future – including economic, natural, and security emergencies.
