## Sozialrecht: Pensionsversicherung im internationalen Vergleich
Pension systems around the world, whether they be social security systems or private sector arrangements, are now under more pressure than ever before.  Significant pension reform is being considered or implemented in many countries due to:
- their ageing populations arising from lower fertility rates and increasing life expectancies 
- increased government debt in some countries- uncertain economic conditions- record low interest rates- a global shift towards greater individual responsibility with de ned contribution plans

### Explain the multi-pillar pension scheme approach according to Holzmann and Hinz (2005)

_(See attachment1.png)_
__Pilar 0:__ A basic pension from public  nances that may be universal or means-tested
__Pilar 1:__ A mandated public pension plan that is publicly managed with contributions and, in some cases,  nancial reserves
__Pilar 2:__ Mandated and fully funded occupational or personal pension plans with  nancial assets
__Pilar 3:__ Voluntary and fully funded occupational or personal pension plans with  nancial assets

__Pilar 4:__A voluntary system outside the pension system with access to a range of  nancial and non- nancial assets and support

### Develop solutions to increase Austria's Mercer Global Pension Index Value
- introducing a minimum access age so that the bene ts from private pension plans are preserved for retirement purposes- increasing coverage of employees in occupational pension schemes thereby increasing the level of contributions and assets (can be done by collective bargaining)
- introducing arrangements to protect the pension interests of both parties in a divorce- enabling individuals to retire gradually whilst receiving a part pension- increasing the labour force participation rate at older ages
