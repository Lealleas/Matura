## Arbeitsrecht & Lohnverrechnung: Vetrag von Lisabon

The Treaty of Lisbon (initially known as the Reform Treaty) is an international agreement which amends the two treaties which form the constitutional basis of the European Union (EU). The Treaty of Lisbon was signed by the EU member states on 13 December 2007, and entered into force on 1 December 2009. It amends the Maastricht Treaty (1993), also known as the Treaty on European Union, and the Treaty of Rome (1958), also known as the Treaty establishing the European Community (TEEC). The Treaty of Lisbon, renamed the Treaty of Rome to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).


### List all European Institutions after the Treaty of Lisbon
In total, there are now seven EU institutions: the European Parliament, European Council, Council, European Commission, European Court of Justice, European Central Bank and European Court of Auditors

__European Parliament__: This body represents voters in the EU’s member countries. The treaty has boosted its powers as regards lawmaking, the EU budget and approval of international agreements. The composition of the parliament has also been changed - the number of MEPs is capped at 751 (750 plus the president of the parliament). Seats are distributed among countries according to “degressive proportionality”, i.e. MEPs from more populous countries will each represent more people than those from smaller countries. No country may now have less than 6 or more than 96 MEPs.

__European Council__: The European Council, which has the role of driving EU policy-making, now becomes a full EU institution. Although it does not gain any new powers, it is headed by a newly created position of president. Elected by the European Council for 2½ years, the main job of the president is to prepare the Council’s work, ensure its continuity and work to secure consensus among member countries. The president cannot simultaneously hold any elected position or office nationally.

__The Council of the European Union__: The Council represents the EU’s member governments. Its role is largely unchanged. It continues to share lawmaking and budget power with the European Parliament and maintain its central role in common foreign and security policy (CFSP) and coordinating economic policies. The main change brought by the Treaty of Lisbon concerns the decision making process. Firstly, the default voting method for the Council is now qualified majority voting, except where the treaties require a different procedure (e.g. a unanimous vote). In practice, this means that qualified majority voting has been extended to many new policy areas (e.g. immigration and culture).

__European Commission__: Its main job is promoting the European public interest. The Treaty offers the perspective that a Commissioner from each Member State becomes Member of the Commission, while under the former Treaties that number would have to be reduced to a number inferior to that of Member States. The president is also stronger, as he/she has the power to dismiss fellow Commissioners.

### Analyse the issues raised by the changes and additions to the wording of the TEU

__Before the Lisbon Treaty__

_The Union is founded on the values for respect for human dignity, liberty, democracy, equality, the rule of law, and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities. These values are common to the Member States in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail._

__After the Lisbon Treaty__

_1. The Union recognizes the rights, freedoms and principles set out in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of 7 December 2000, as adapted at Strasbourg, on 12 December 2007, which shall have the same legal value as the Treaties.The provisions of the Charter shall not extend in any way the competences of the Union as defined in the Treaties.The rights, freedoms and principles in the Charter shall be interpreted in accordance with the general provisions in Title VII of the Charter governing its interpretation and application and with due regard to the explanations referred to in the Charter, that set out the sources of those provisions.__2. The Union shall accede to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Such accession shall not affect the Unionís competences as defined in the Treaties._
_3. Fundamental rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms and as they result from the constitutional traditions common to the Member States, shall constitute general principles of Unionís law._

__Answer / Problems:__

__The Charter of Fundamental Rights:__ The Charter is not incorporated into the Treaty by text, but only appears by reference. The text of the Charter was adapted on 12 December 2007 (OJ 2007 C 303/1). The most important changes were carried out earlier, during the work of the Convention on the Constitutional Treaty. Four paragraphs were added to Art. 52, and to better reflect the changes in the content of the article its title has been changed from ëScope of guaranteed rightsí to _Scope and interpretation of rights and principles_.

__The relationship between the Charter and the case law on general principles of law:__ The fact that the Charter is addressed to the Member States _only when they are implementing Union law_, casts doubt on the well-established principle that fundamental rights bind the Member States whenever they are acting _within the scope of Community law_, even when they are derogating from the Treaty. The question is whether this is simply a drafting deficiency that can be remedied by broader interpretation on the part of the Court, ensuring consistency with its case law on general principles, or whether that wording will require a change in the Courtís case law. If the latter is going to be the case, one wonders what the role to be played by the general principles of law would be, what would their relationship be with the corresponding provisions of the Charter, which one is to take priority etc.

### Develop a new metaphor for the EU after the Lisbon Treaty

_(See attachment1.png and attachment2.png and attachment3.png)_

Between 1993 and 2009, the European Union (EU) legally comprised three pillars. This structure was introduced with the Treaty of Maastricht on 1 November 1993, and was eventually abandoned on 1 December 2009 upon the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, when the EU obtained a consolidated legal personality.

1. The European Communities pillar handled economic, social and environmental policies. It comprised the European Community (EC), the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC, until its expiry in 2002), and the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM).
2. The Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) pillar took care of foreign policy and military matters.
3. Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters (PJCCM) brought together co-operation in the fight against crime. This pillar was originally named Justice and Home Affairs (JHA).

In a speech before the Nice Conference, Joschka Fischer, then Foreign Minister of Germany, called for a simplification of the European Union. One of these core ideas was to abolish the pillar structure, and replace it with a merged legal personality for the Union. This idea was included in the Treaty of Lisbon, which entered into force on 1 December 2009. With a legal personality, Union is, for instance, able to be part of international treaties. The Treaty of Lisbon also states that "the Union shall replace and succeed the European Community," with the effect that, once the Treaty entered into force, the EU obtained the membership of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) which had belonged to the European Communities pillar.

The abolition of the "3-pillar structure" was welcomed by practitioners and academics who had long considered the 'pillar metaphor" to be unrealistic, if not absurd. The idea that one pillar could be the Communities, while the other two were merely "policies" or "cooperation" was scarcely credible.
